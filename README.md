You're absolutely right—**not everyone should be allowed to leave a review** in a travel package booking system. To maintain authenticity and prevent spam or misuse, certain **conditions or rules** should be enforced before a customer can submit a review. Here are the **key conditions** that typically apply:

---

### ✅ **Conditions for Allowing a Customer to Submit a Review**

1. **Completed Booking**
   - The customer must have successfully booked and completed a travel package.
   - This ensures that only genuine users who experienced the service can leave feedback.

2. **Booking Status: Completed or Delivered**
   - The booking status should be marked as **"Completed"**, **"Travelled"**, or **"Delivered"** in the system.
   - Reviews should not be allowed for cancelled or pending bookings.

3. **One Review per Booking**
   - Each customer should be allowed to submit **only one review per booking** to avoid spam or manipulation.

4. **User Authentication**
   - The customer must be **logged in** to their account.
   - Anonymous or guest users should not be allowed to post reviews.

5. **Time Limit (Optional)**
   - Some systems allow reviews only within a certain time frame after the trip (e.g., within 30 days of completion).

6. **No Prior Review for Same Package (Optional)**
   - If the customer has already reviewed the same package in a previous booking, you might restrict or flag it.

7. **Review Content Validation**
   - The review text should be checked for:
     - Minimum length (e.g., at least 20 characters)
     - No offensive or inappropriate language
     - Optional: Sentiment analysis or moderation
